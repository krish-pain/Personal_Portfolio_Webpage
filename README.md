As a computer science student and a fresher, I wanted to create a professional way to present myself to potential employers and showcase my skills and projects effectively. Many candidates face challenges in standing out during the hiring process, and I realized a personal portfolio webpage could be a perfect solution. It provides a structured and visually appealing platform to highlight my work and make a strong first impression.
